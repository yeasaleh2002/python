# assingment operator
'''
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator    	Example	            Same As
=	            x = 5	            x = 5
+=	            x += 3	            x = x + 3
-=	            x -= 3	            x = x - 3
*=	            x *= 3	            x = x * 3
/=	            x /= 3	            x = x / 3
%=	            x %= 3	            x = x % 3
//=	            x //=f 3	            x = x // 3
**=	            x **= 3	            x = x ** 3
&=	            x &= 3	            x = x & 3
|=	            x |= 3	            x = x | 3
^=	            x ^= 3	            x = x ^ 3
>>=	            x >>= 3	            x = x >> 3
<<=	            x <<= 3	            x = x << 3
:=	            print(x := 3)	    x = 3
                                    print(x)

#comparison operator
'''
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:


Operator    	Name	                        Example
==	            Equal	                        x == y	
!=	            Not equal	                    x != y	
>	            Greater than	                x > y	
<	            Less than	                    x < y	
>=	            Greater than or equal to	    x >= y	
<=	            Less than or equal to	        x <= y

#logical operator
'''
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator	            Description                                     	Example
and     	Returns True if both statements are true	                x < 5 and  x < 10	
or      	Returns True if one of the statements is true           	x < 5 or x < 4	
not     	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	    not(x < 5 and x < 10)
