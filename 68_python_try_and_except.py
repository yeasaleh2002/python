# python try except
'''
* python try except:
- the 'try' block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- the 'except' block lets you handle the error.
- the 'else' block lets you execute code when there is no error.
- the 'finallay' block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.

# exception handling:
when an error occurs, or exception as we call it, python will normally stop and generate an error message.
these exceptions can be handled using the try statement.
